* FPGA_pin_demo.* : A design with two XC6SLX150 in the FGG484 package. No
                    power supply, interface logic or connectors.

The FPGA_pin_demo shows how to connect the different parts of the FPGA and
routes all signals on a 4-layer PCB. The minimum sizes are taken from the
discussion on the forum.
