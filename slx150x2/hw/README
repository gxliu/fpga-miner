This directory is reserved for the hardware design.

Current contents:

* FPGAcomp.lib    : Eagle library containing custom components for design
* FPGA_pin_demo.* : A design with two XC6SLX150 in the FGG484 package. No
                    power supply, interface logic or connectors.

The FPGA_pin_demo shows how to connect the different parts of the FPGA and
routes all signals on a 2-layer PCB. The minimum sizes are compatible with
the "standard" PCB-Pool restrictions.

TODO:

* There is a choke-point on the bottom layer in the middle of each FPGA:
  the polygon is too narrow for 5A or more. Need to route some VCCaux
  pins on the top layer, over unused pins of the FPGA.
* No 4-eyes check run, yet. Second opinion needed.
